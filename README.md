Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:





Node.js (v16 or higher): Download from nodejs.org.



npm or yarn: npm comes with Node.js; yarn can be installed via npm install -g yarn.



Git: Download from git-scm.com.



React Native CLI and dependencies (for mobile):





Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS).



Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher for Android.



Watchman (for macOS users): brew install watchman.



PostgreSQL (or your preferred database): Install from postgresql.org or use a cloud service.



A code editor like Visual Studio Code.

Backend Setup





Navigate to the Backend Directory:

cd backend



Install Dependencies:

npm install

or, if using yarn:

yarn install



Set Up Environment Variables:





Create a .env file in the backend/ directory.



Add the following variables (adjust as needed):

PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret



Replace username, password, and dbname with your PostgreSQL credentials.



Set Up the Database:





Ensure PostgreSQL is running.



Create a database:

psql -U username -c "CREATE DATABASE dbname;"



Run migrations (if applicable):

npm run migrate



Start the Backend:

npm start





The backend should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

Mobile App Setup





Navigate to the Mobile Directory:

cd mobile



Install Dependencies:

npm install

or, if using yarn:

yarn install



Set Up Environment Variables:





Create a .env file in the mobile/ directory.



Add the backend API URL:

API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api



For Android emulators, use http://10.0.2.2:5000/api instead of localhost.



Set Up Mobile Development Environment:





For Android:





Install Android Studio and set up an emulator or connect a physical device.



Ensure the Android SDK is configured.



For iOS:





Install Xcode and set up a simulator or connect an iOS device.



Run pod install in the mobile/ios/ directory if using CocoaPods.



Start the Metro Bundler:

npm start





This starts the JavaScript bundler for React Native.



Run the Mobile App:





For Android:

npm run android



For iOS:

npm run ios



The app should launch on your emulator/simulator or device.

Running the Project





Start the Backend:





Ensure the backend is running (npm start in the backend/ directory).



Verify the API is accessible at http://localhost:5000 (or your configured port).



Start the Mobile App:





Run the Metro bundler (npm start in the mobile/ directory).



Launch the app on Android or iOS using the commands above.



The mobile app should connect to the backend API using the API_URL from the .env file.



Testing the Connection:





Open the mobile app and perform an action that triggers an API call (e.g., login or fetch data).



Check the backend terminal for logs to confirm the request was received.
